Hello and thank you for checking out my awesome Blackjack game!

As this program uses UCurses for rendering it is only built for Linux as the dependancy NCurses
is not available on Windows. You can play the game under release/linux64 if you have the operating system.

Check out the UCurses repo at https://github.com/Roguelight/ucurses.git if you are interested how some of the
GUI widgets and window management happens!

Run ./Blackjack++ in your CLI to play the game!
